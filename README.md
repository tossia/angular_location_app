# Mon Angular Project
My project created with Angular by following a [Tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app)
This is not the first Angular test application, but the most elaborated.
I will continue to work on and it will be published soon. :)

## Database
I used fake data at the moment, but I'm thinking to use normal database stored in SQL.. or MariaDB.. or I will see


# Angular version
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.0.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
